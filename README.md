## Architecture

Frontend communicates with a [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) backend via RESTful API for authentication, data storage, and business logic. Ensure the backend is running and accessible for full functionality.

Backend repo: [tsimpologion-backend](https://github.com/Pravinos/tsimpologion-backend)

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the app**
   - Development:  `$env:NODE_ENV="development"; npx expo start --clear`
   - Production:   `$env:NODE_ENV="production"; npx expo start --clear`
   - Default:      `npx expo start`
   Then choose to open in a development build, Android emulator, iOS simulator, or [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go).
3. **Environment Configuration**
   - `.env.development` for development API endpoints
   - `.env.production` for production API endpoints
   Setting `NODE_ENV` loads the corresponding environment file automatically.
4. **Production Updates**
   ```bash
   eas update --branch main
   ```
5. **Develop**

   Edit files in the `app` directory. Routing is file-based ([docs](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/)).
